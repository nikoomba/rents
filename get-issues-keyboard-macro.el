;;; This keyboard macro is for going through the code to where "ISSUE" is marked in the comments, grabbing the issue,
;;; putting it in a text file and then naming the function / class where the issue occurs. 
;;; It functions as a sort of easy to-do list generator for this project, so one can see the context of everything that
;;; remains to be done.
;;;
;;; It might be useful to convert this to emacs lisp in the future. But a keyboard macro is a rough and ready way of doing it.
